The data file takes the size of the map in rows and columns in the first line, the rest of the data file is the map of the desert , with "o" being empty space in game and the rest being the same type of location as their name suggests.

Oasis:"Replenish water"
Sphinx:"Mythical creature that asks riddles and provides key upon success to open the mysterious massive door"
Crystals:"magic crystals are a source of power, you can't use them directly but maybe helps in your way out"
Portal:"X marks the spot. Portal is your way out, but it is blocked by a massive door you cant seem to open"

The victory conditions are to find atleast 3 crystals, find the sphinx, answer its riddles, and finally to go to portal and exit the desert.
